## Description
This quiz allows the user 1 minute to complete a series of 10 questions pertaining to Star Trek. A correct answer awards 1 point and advances to the following question. An incorrect answer will move you onto the following question - but will also accelerate the timer 10 by seconds and reward 0 points. By completing the quiz before the timer runs-out, you will be given the option to save your high-score and initials. If the timer runs out...it is game over.

## How to
Click <Begin-Quiz> to start.

Choose your answers via <multiple-choice>.
Answer correctly, advance.
Answer incorrectly, advance with punishment (10+ seconds added to timer).
If the timer runs out, it is game over - no option to join the leader board.
